## React & Apollo Client Tutorial

This repository contains the source code of a fully-featured Hackernews clone built with React and Apollo Client as presented by [this tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction) from How to GraphQL.

### Changes

This repository uses Apollo Client 3.0, which is distributed from a different package, and as a result, most of the imports had to be updated. More information can be found in [Migrating to Apollo Client 3.0](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/).

### Installation and usage

I recommend following [the tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction) instead of running code directly from this repository.
